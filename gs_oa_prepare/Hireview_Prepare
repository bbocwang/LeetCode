q1: Tell me about a time when a teacher or manager questioned a decision you made and you had to explain your reasoning behind the decision
-what was your thought process for determining your decision?
-what was the outcome?
-Looking back would you have done anything differently to make the decision?
ans: This question reminds me of When I was applying the position of the tutor, and at that time I was interviewed by the lecturer, I decided to apply for the tutor of the software engineering course, after he reviewed my profile, and realized that the software engineering course is the only course that I got a B last year, he questioned me about why don't I apply for the course that I have much better performance last year, and I told the lecturer what I'm thinking is that I've heard a theory called bucket theory, basiclly that means A bucket can only fill with the volume of water the shortest plank allows. and in this situation, I think this software engineering course is basiclly the shortest plank of my bucket, and I wanna improve my shortest plank to improve my overall ability. and doing tutoring job is a good oportunity to understand this course in a different way. and the outcome is that this convinced my lecturer and he accepted my application. and looking back, I still think




q2:Your teacher assigns you to a group to complete an important class project. the classmates in your assigned group all know each other really well and you do not know any of them. What would you do in this situation to ensure you work effectively with the group?
-What steps would you take to relate to your classmates?
-How would you learn more about your classmates' experiences, perspectives, and background?
First thing I can come up with is before the work begins it might be a good idea to introduce myself to them to let my teammates know my background and my experence and then maybe suggest them to introduce themselves to me as well and during that I'll try to remember every one's name and get familiar with them by having a small chat with them about something they might interested in like football matches, or news.
If they already have assigned different part of work to different people, I'll need to discuss with them to find out which part of work I can help with. and during the work I might have a chat with different teammates individually to make friends with them, and try if I can share experience with them and help each other.  


q3: You decided to take and extra class this semester and are feeling overwhelmed with all the course work.
You have and individual project due soon that is required to be completed on your own without the help of others.
Your classmate asks if you would be interested in working together on the project and sharing answers.
If you keep working independently, you do not think you will be abled to finish on time. 
-what would you do?
-What would be your thought process for determining what to do?
-What factors would you consider?
-What would you say to your classmate?
I will definitely refuse to work with him, because we have been told this is a individual project and can not do it with the help of others. and we need to be honest to our teacher.  my thought process will be: the most important thing is honest and I'll never lie to my teacher or classmates even if I have the risk of cannot finish my project befor the ddl, finishing the project before the ddl with the help of my classmates is much worse than not finishing it but work on myself, because I'm not lying.
I will try to convince my classmate don't try to get help from others anymore and encourage him to work on his own.


q4: overcome obstacles/adversity
My story is that when I'm in second year, I have a coursework ask me to develop a system using java, and the lecturer assumes all of us have already know java, so there's no help to learning how to use java before that, but I never used java before that, and I have 10 days to finish this project. 
First time I looked at the provided code, I feel like I know nothing about it and I feel very stressful because it'a big challange to construct a system using java without any pre knoledge of java in ten days. so I started on the day that the coursework is released. I made a plan, set some milestones like what thing I should finish in perticular time. I dicided to start by learn how to use java first and that takes me three days, and finish the project in a week. first time I using java it feels very awkward, and I feel like that I cannot create anything with it, but I force myself to spend 5 hours on this project every day, and after a few days I feel like I'm learning new things every day and get more and more familiar with it and  finally I finished my project before the ddl. from this experience I learned that for those kind of adversities, I need to start early and make a plan first, try to work on it several hours everyday instead of start to work on it one day before the ddl and continues to work 24 hours without relax. the learning of a new knowledge is done iteratively, in this way I can understand it more deeply.
